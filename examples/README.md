# Lime examples

Faithful, **line-by-line** Haxe/Lime ports of every example under [`upstream/examples/packages`](../upstream/examples/packages), written directly against the generated Flight Haxe surface (`flighthq.*`). Each example is an ordinary, **self-contained** Lime project — a `project.xml` and a single `Main.hx` — with no shared base class or helper module.

## Structure

Each `Main.hx` is a standalone `lime.app.Application`. Every statement of the upstream `app.ts` is translated faithfully; only the irreducible browser glue is adapted onto Lime's lifecycle:

- The Flight app backend is wired in `onWindowCreate` with `App.setAppBackend(LimeApp.createLimeAppBackend(this))`, followed by the GL render-state setup and renderer registration for the kinds the example draws.
- The upstream `./render` module and `render(root)` become the `render(context)` override; its `scale` becomes `window.scale`.
- `requestAnimationFrame` + `performance.now()` become the `update(deltaTime)` override.
- `window` keyboard/pointer listeners become Lime's `onKeyDown`/`onKeyUp`/`onMouseDown`/`onMouseMove`/`onMouseUp`/`onMouseWheel`/`onTextInput` overrides.
- Browser-only asset painting (Canvas-2D texture generation, DOM control panels, Web Audio/Video output) is reduced to a minimal in-file stub that keeps the surrounding Flight SDK call sites identical.

The full scene graph, materials, meshes, labels, and per-frame logic are otherwise a direct port. 3D examples (`scene3d`, `skeleton`) inline the upstream WebGL scene path (`createGlRenderEffectPipeline` → `prepareSceneRender` → `drawGlScene`).

## Prerequisites

Running an example needs a Haxe compiler and the Lime command-line tool on the host. `npm run setup` provisions the repository-local Haxe and the pinned Haxe libraries (including the `lime` classpath used at compile time), but the Lime _command_ that turns a `project.xml` into a build is a separate Haxelib install:

```sh
haxelib install lime      # provides the `lime` command plus its native ndll
```

Haxe itself can come from the repo-local toolchain (`npm run setup`), a system package (`apt install haxe`), or npm. The `html5` target compiles to JavaScript and needs no native `lime.ndll`; the desktop targets (`linux`/`windows`/`mac`) additionally require Lime's native library — the prebuilt one from a Lime Haxelib release, or `lime rebuild cpp`.

## Running

From an example directory, use Lime normally:

```sh
cd examples/clock
lime test html5
lime test linux     # or windows / mac
```

The root convenience command delegates to the same Lime project:

```sh
npm run example -- clock html5
```

Each `project.xml` loads this checkout as the local `flight` Haxelib (maintained `src/` and generated `generated/` classpaths). No Vite, npm dev server, or JavaScript bridge is involved.
